            <h4>Targeting strategy for bronchial thermoplasty--PhD project</h4>
            <p>Bronchial thermoplasty is an asthma treatment, which targets the excessive airway smooth muscle that obstructs flow in asthmatics.
                This project aims to develop selecting methods to find the best treatment airway sests for patients, thus optimizing the efficacy of bronchial thermoplasty.
                I have developed as few optimization algorithms on several mathematical modelling of bronchial tree to find the optimal airway sets for bronchial thermoplasty.
